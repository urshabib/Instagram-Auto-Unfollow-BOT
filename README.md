Instagram Auto Unfollow Bot ⚡
A premium, open-source dashboard designed to help you clean your Instagram following list safely and efficiently. No more manual checking; let the bot handle the work while you stay in the safe zone.

🛡️ Security & Privacy (100% Local)
Your privacy is non-negotiable.

100% Open Source: Transparent code available for audit.

Zero Data Collection: This extension does not see, use, or receive your data. Everything stays on your machine.

Local Processing: Data analysis and filtering happen strictly within your browser.

Safe & Legal: Uses the MIT License, protecting you and the developer while ensuring the code remains free.

🚀 How to Use the Extension
Once you have installed the extension and have your Instagram data ZIP ready (see instructions below), follow these steps:

Load Your Data
Drag and drop your Instagram ZIP file directly into the dashboard, or click to select it from your files.

Note: Scroll down to the next section if you don't have your ZIP folder yet.

Set Your Protection Filters
Select the types of accounts you want the bot to skip. You can protect Verified celebrities, Business/Creator accounts, or anyone with a high follower count.

Configure Your Speed & Limits

Cycle Speed: The time the bot waits between opening new tabs.

Action Speed: The time the bot waits between clicking "Unfollow" buttons inside the tab.

Unfollow Limit: Enter exactly how many people you want to remove in this session.

Start the Purge
Press the Start Session button.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do not use Instagram in your browser while the extension is running. The bot needs full control of the Instagram tabs it opens to perform the actions correctly.
